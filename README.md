## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an Architect-turned-Data Analyst from India with 3 years of experience as an Interior Draftsman and Technical Designer, working with international teams across the US and the Netherlands. I moved to Eindhoven, Netherlands last year! My passion for data and analytical thinking has driven a successful career pivot into the field of data analytics.

I recently completed an intensive Data Analytics & AI Bootcamp with Amsterdam Data Academy, where I worked on real-world projects involving data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling. Iâ€™m also actively expanding my knowledge through Courseraâ€™s Google Data Analytics and IBM Statistics courses.

Tools & Skills: Excel, SQL, Power BI, Qlik Sense, Python (Pandas, NumPy), Data Cleaning, Visualization, EDA
Projects: Sales Forecasting Models, Dashboard Development, Construction Health & Safety Analysis
Strengths: Design thinking, analytical mindset, attention to detail, cross-functional collaboration

Iâ€™m currently seeking opportunities in data analytics in Netherlands where I can apply both my technical and creative problem-solving skills to real-world challenges.
